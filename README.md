## Fullstack Take Home

### Task:
- Create a simple web app, hosted at a URL we can visit
- Users can enter a URL of a page to fetch
- The web app fetches the HTML of the page and displays the source to the user
- A summary of the document is displayed, listing which tags are present in the HTML and how many of each tag
- (Optional) Clicking on the name of each tag in the summary will highlight the tags in the source code view

Please provide all source code via a Git repository â€“ create a local repo for your code, and when the exercise is complete, please tar or zip your main directory and send it along to us (and please remember to include your .git directory/files).

The exercise can typically be completed in 3-6 hours of work, but feel free to use more or less time if necessary.

It can be completed using whichever language/technology/framework you prefer, but the finished product should be something you'd be proud to show us!
